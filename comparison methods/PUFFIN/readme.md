<h2>Implementation:</h2>
The trained model download link provided in the PUFFIN GitHub repository (https://github.com/gifford-lab/PUFFIN) is inactive, and no model details are publicly available.
However, we managed to extract the 5-cv and LOMO scores directly from the supplementary material of DeepMHCII paper, which offers some insights into the modelâ€™s performance, albeit not as comprehensive as if direct model access had been possible.
