# NetMHCIIpan-4.0

## Web Server address: 

https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCIIpan-4.0/

## Implementation:

We downloaded the software version of NetMHCIIpan-4.0 for prediction evaluation of independent test sets BD2023 and BD2024 as well as prediction of binding cores. 
The training code for NetMHCIIpan-4.0 has not been made available to the public. Consequently, we were unable to generate the 5-fold cross-validation (5-cv) and leave-one-molecule-out (LOMO) metrics, which require access to the internal workings of the algorithm.
