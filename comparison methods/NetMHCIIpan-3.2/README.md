## Web Server address: 

https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCIIpan-3.2/

## Implementation:

We downloaded the software version of NetMHCIIpan-3.2 for prediction evaluation of independent test sets BD2023 and BD2024 as well as prediction of binding cores. 
The 5-cv and LOMO experimental results are from the supplementary materials provided by DeepMHCII.
